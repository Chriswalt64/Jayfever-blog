<h1 id="first-a-note-on-themes">First, a note on themes</h1>
<p>Themes were not as obvious as I initially thought. I followed the documentation and tried to use Gem based themes, but no matter what I tried they wouldn’t take.</p>

<p>It turns out, if you have files in your layouts or includes directories, they override any themes you have setup. So all I had to do was wipe out essentially everything in there and <strong>voila</strong> - Jayfever’s Blog now uses the YAT theme.</p>

<p>Also, you’ll notice a huge mess of characters at the bottom of my last post. I tried plugging in some ASCII art, and that was a big fail.</p>

<h3 id="but-im-a-believer-in-failure">But I’m a believer in failure.</h3>

<p>Failing is a requirement to progress and grow. And since this blog is basically going  to act as a dumping ground for me and my web dev escapades, I’m not going to hide mistakes like that. I will point them out later, so that anybody who reads this can watch and learn.</p>

<p>I dont have much else to talk about. I got the theme going, and thats the big thing. I did some other stuff like getting banners up and Favicons, but I’ll talk about that later. I’m sleepy.</p>

<p><strong><em>later</em></strong></p>
