I"2<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">You’ll find this post in your '_posts' directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run 'jekyll serve', which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Looks like I found the post in the _posts directory. And now I’m talking to myself. Great</em></strong></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">To add new posts, simply add a file in the '_posts' directory that follows the convention 'YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext' and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</code></p>

<p><strong><em>The necessary front matter. That sounds like a euphemism</em></strong></p>

<p>`Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
