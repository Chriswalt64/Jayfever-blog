I"À<p>Web development has always felt just outside and to the left of my â€œCircle of comfortâ€ when it comes to programming. Iâ€™ve always been essentially a backend developer. Honestly that may not even be the right term. My entire career has been working in higher education Information Technology, and I have always programmed in proprietary environments using proprietary languages that really only get used within their respective systems.</p>
