## Man, Its been a minute.

I totally fell off of working on this an updating it. Thats fine, this whole endeavor was supposed to be a chill and low pressure side thing. But its time to get back in the saddle. Back to learning web dev stuff and making mistakes and putting it out there for people to see. Not that anyone would see it, but nevertheless. 

I also think I would like to have a site that is a little more robust. Maybe let people create accounts and comment. Maybe see some analytics stuff. That kind of thing.

I also want to branch this out fomr being just a developer blog. I want to talk about other stuff. Like Dungeons & Dragons. That shit is awesome. Or video games. Those are awesome too. 

I'm just going to let this thing roll and see where it takes me.

# Peace
