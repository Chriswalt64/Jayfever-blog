# First, a note on themes
Themes were not as obvious as I initially thought. I followed the documentation and tried to use Gem based themes, but no matter what I tried they wouldn't take. 

It turns out, if you have files in your layouts or includes directories, they override any themes you have setup. So all I had to do was wipe out essentially everything in there and __voila__ - Jayfever's Blog now uses the YAT theme. 

Also, you'll notice a huge mess of characters at the bottom of my last post. I tried plugging in some ASCII art, and that was a big fail. 

### But I'm a believer in failure.

Failing is a requirement to progress and grow. And since this blog is basically going  to act as a dumping ground for me and my web dev escapades, I'm not going to hide mistakes like that. I will point them out later, so that anybody who reads this can watch and learn. 

##

I dont have much else to talk about. I got the theme going, and thats the big thing. I did some other stuff like getting banners up and Favicons, but I'll talk about that later. I'm sleepy.
