`You’ll find this post in your '_posts' directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run 'jekyll serve', which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.`

***Looks like I found the post in the _posts directory. And now I'm talking to myself. Great***

`To add new posts, simply add a file in the '_posts' directory that follows the convention 'YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext' and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.`

***The necessary front matter. That sounds like a euphemism***

`Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}`

***I dont know Ruby, did I make a mistake?***
